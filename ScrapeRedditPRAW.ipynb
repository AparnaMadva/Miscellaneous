What I will say is that you look very young. It’s natural to have smile lines - I’ve had mine since I was a teenager. They haven’t changed at all but they’ve just always been there. The sagging you’re seeing just looks like a normal chin. When you take a picture from that angle it’s going to look that way - your head is pointed down and that’s going to cause the skin under your chin to bunch together to create that effect. There’s nothing wrong with it, though - kind of just how skin works lol \\n\\nAt the end of the day, it’s up to you. If you want a face lift, that’s your choice. I don’t think it will really be worth it - I think the results will be minimal to none on one end and just weird and uncanny on the other. \\n Just came here to say (28F to 28F) you are stunning 💖💖💖 \\n try lymphatic drainage! You can use your hands or a Gua Sha stone. Look up some videos on youtube! It helps a lot with sagging. Our faces carry a lot of lymphatic fluid that builds up over time, making us look “puffy” and “saggy.” There’s specific techniques though so make sure you do them correctly and in the right order. I would recommend it every morning. \\n You look much younger than you really are. What is the issue you are concerned about? \\n yesss its not even anything inn25 Yeats u will wish...actually in 8 years u will wish u had ur face today. so hushhh \\n I’ll probably get downvoted into oblivion, but this’ll definitely help\\u202f—\\u202feat a high-fat, meat-heavy ketogenic diet and your skin will become the best it’s been in many years. Bad skin is a lack of nutrients and excess inflammation, which a diet close to full carnivory, ‘the caveman diet’, will treat.\", '1igjegs': \" \\n Don't ask for or hand out medical diagnoses.

Maybe drink a light daily detox tea to help your liver and kidneys too.\\n\\nLook into a more natural way to eat to feed your things that make it heal and try acupuncture. \\n I think your skin is peeling to heal itself.

Until your skin clears up i would refrain from hand washing your clothes and only use the most basic, hypoallergenic, fragrance free soaps for everything. \\n When skin is damaged, it has to grow new skin cells under the damage.
